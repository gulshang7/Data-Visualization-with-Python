# Data Visualization

Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.

Data visualization can be utilized for a variety of purposes, and it’s important to note that is not only reserved for use by data teams. Management also leverages it to convey organizational structure and hierarchy while data analysts and data scientists use it to discover and explain patterns and trends. 

In the following Data Visualization, I have used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization with the help of NumPy and Pandas library to make some simple and easy to understand charts, plots, graphs etc.
