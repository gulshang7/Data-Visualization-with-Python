# Seaborn

Seaborn is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. 
It provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. 
It is built on the top of matplotlib library and also closely integrated to the data structures from pandas.
Seaborn aims to make visualization the central part of exploring and understanding data. 
It provides dataset-oriented APIs, so that we can switch between different visual representations for same variables for better understanding of dataset.

Plots are basically used for visualizing the relationship between variables. Those variables can be either be completely numerical or a category like a group, class or division. Seaborn divides plot into the below categories â€“ 
 

- Relational plots 
- Categorical plots
- Distribution plots
- Regression plots
- Matrix plots
- Multi-plot grids
